class MSACondition(object):
    """
    A Condition is the configuration of a mapping, its attribute and an
    operator. It tells you if it itself is true or false given an input.
    The ``mapping`` defines what this condition is checking.  Perhaps it's a
    ``User`` or ``Request`` object. The ``attribute`` name is then extracted out
    of an instance of the mapping to produce a variable. That variable is then
    compared to the operator to determine if the condition applies to the input
    or not.
    For example, for the request IP address, you would define a ``Request``
    mapping, that had an ``ip`` property.  A condition would then be constructed
    like so:
    from myapp import RequestMapping
    from msaSDK.features.base import MSACondition
        >> condition = Condition(mapping=RequestMapping, attribute='ip', operator=some_operator)
    When the Condition is called, it is passed the input. The mapping is then
    called (constructed) with input object to produce an instance.  The
    attribute is then extracted from that instance to produce the variable.
    The extracted variable is then checked against the operator.
    To put it another way, say you wanted a condition to only allow your switch
    to people between 15 and 30 years old.  To make the condition:
        1. You would create a ``UserMapping`` class that takes a user object in
           its constructor.  The class also has an ``age`` method which returns
           the user object's age.
        2. You would then create a new Condition via:
           ``Condition(mapping=UserInput, attribute='age', operator=Between(15, 30))``.
        3. You then call that condition with a ``User``, and it would return
           ``True`` if the age of the user the ``UserMapping`` instance wraps
           is between 15 and 30.
